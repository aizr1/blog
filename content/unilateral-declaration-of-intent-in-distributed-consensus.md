Lately the question whether some legal record is a contract or not, came up more often than I thought. So I needed to clarify this to myself.
 
All declarations of intent are a form of legal transaction. This means it is a legal obligation about something involving specific participants.

> Legal transactions are the base for legal obligation[^sa]

In local law, a legal transaction consists of a declaration of intent made by a person with legal capacity.  A right or an obligation are not inferred from a declaration of intent directly, but from the legal transaction which results from it.

In the case of **unilateral legal transactions**, only one declaration of intent is necessary for the legal transaction to become effective.

e.g. a power of attorney document to be able to get a package on behalf on someone else

In the case of **two-sided legal transactions**, two declarations of intent are necessary in order to conclude a valid legal transaction. These declarations of intent must be completely congruent. If the two contracting parties have not yet agreed on a point of the legal transaction, no legal transaction exists.

e.g. a binding (signed) contract between two parties

However, this does not mean that both sides also enter into an obligation.

A distinction is therefore made between unilaterally binding legal transactions and bilaterally binding legal transactions.

> **Conclusion**: A contract is only valid if both parties agree on the same scope of legal binding and obligation and record the agreement.
